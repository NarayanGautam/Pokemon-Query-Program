# Pokemon Query Program

## Program Info: 
Admin will start the pokemon property server, which will listen for any connection requests, and when the user starts the pokemon query client, it will establish a connection to the server, display a menu for the user to either perform a pokemon type query, which sends a request to the server for all matching pokemon of the queried type, or if user decides to save results of completed queries to a file, or quit the program and all running queries.

## Purpose: 
To practice File Input/Output, reading and writing from files, practice multithreading, inter-process communication through the use of socket connections between a client and server using the TCP connection model. It also aims to learn about file structure and organization of .c and header files, C libraries, as well as simplifying the compilation process through make files.

## Compile Instructions:
1. On the terminal type `make`
2. To run server, run `./server`
3. To run client, run `./client`
